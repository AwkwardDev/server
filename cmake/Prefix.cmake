### Input Variables
# PREFIX, optionally defined by the user
#   Gived the desired install directory path (absolute or relative to root
#   source directory).
#
### Defined Variables
# BIN_DIR, the absolute path to the directory containing the executables
#   and libraries
# CONF_DIR, the absolute path to the directory containing the configuration
#   files
#
### Modified CMake Variables
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, the absolute path to the install directory
# CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR (mac)
# CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH (other unix)
# CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH (unix)

  # install directory will be used.
  # Note: path are relative to the root source folder.

    # install name can include "@loader_path" which is the directory containing
    # the code loading the library (an executable or another library).
    #
    # Since Mac OS 10.5, RPATH (see below) is supported. However, the install
    # name still needs to be specified, and needs to include "@rpath" which will
    # be tentatively replaced by the supplied paths. The paths can in turn
    # contain "@loader_path". Since our library is always at the same place
    # relative to the executables, this is no use to us.

  # some libraries cannot be found anyway).
