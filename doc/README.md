# Documentation Index

`INSTALL.md` provides an installation guide for the server. This covers getting
the sources from github, compiling, setting up the database, etc.

The other files are pre-Silverpine. They are probably useful in one way or
another, but we still have to review them.

If you want to edit the markdown files, you may find the
[github-markup-preview](https://github.com/norswap/github-markup-preview) gem
useful.
