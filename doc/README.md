# Documentation Index

`INSTALL.md` provides an installation guide for the server. This covers getting
the sources from github, compiling, setting up the database, etc.

The `doc.rb` script can be used to monitor markdown files and compile them to
html with the github style. Run it to view a more detailed description.

The other files are pre-Silverpine. They are probably useful in one way or
another, but we still have to review them.
