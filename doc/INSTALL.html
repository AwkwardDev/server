<h2 id='supported_operating_systems'>Supported Operating Systems</h2>

<p>We support Linux and Windows (we use Windows 7, but everything will probably work on XP, Vista and 8 as well). We did not test other Unices than Linux.</p>

<p>Mac OS is unsupported. That&#8217;s because none of the devs uses a Mac. Also, you can install Windows or Linux on a Mac.</p>

<h2 id='troubleshooting'>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Post any question, suggestions or remarks you might have on <a href='http://project-silverpine.com/forums'>the forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id='what_youll_need'>What you&#8217;ll need.</h2>

<p>For the Linux guys: you can use the package manager supplied by your distribution to get most of the software listed below.</p>

<h3 id='git'>Git</h3>

<p>On Windows, get either <a href='http://windows.github.com/'>Github for Windows</a> if you want a GUI interface or <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/'>msys-git</a> if you want only the command line interface. Note that you can have the command line interface with Github for Windows too, just launch the shortcut named &#8220;Git Shell&#8221; (or fiddle with your <code>PATH</code> environment variable).</p>

<h3 id='a_mysql_server'>A MySQL Server</h3>

<p>MySQL is a database system. You can get a free MySQL server <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/'>here</a>. I recommend to install this only when you reach the section called <a href='#installing_the_database_server'>Setting Up The Database</a> as it deals directly with the post-install configuration step.</p>

<h3 id='an_sql_frontend'>An SQL Frontend</h3>

<p>An SQL frontend is a piece of software that can connect to the database in order to display/modify its data. It can also run queries to retrieve/modify bits of data that match specific conditions.</p>

<p>I recommend using the official <a href='http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/'>MySQL workbench</a>. Install this after having installed the SQL server.</p>

<p>Installation on Windows is straightforward. On Linux, packages are supplied for some popular distributions. Note that you might have success using those package with other distributions that use the same package system. Also note that you might have to resolve the dependencies for the package. For instance to install on Debian I ran the following commands and selected the aptitude resolution that installs the missing dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i mysql-workbench-gpl-5.2.43-1ubu1004-i386.deb
sudo aptitude -f install</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work out for you, then you&#8217;ll have to build from sources.</p>

<p>Of course everything those tools do can be achieved on the command line with the <code>mysql</code> command.</p>

<h3 id='cmake'>CMake</h3>

<p>CMake is a build configuration tool. It will generate files that our build system of choice can then use to compile the server. <a href='http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html'>Get it here</a> (take the binary distribution, unless you know what you are doing). Add CMake to the system path (this is an installer option).</p>

<h3 id='a_c_compiler__build_system'>A C++ Compiler + Build System</h3>

<p>On Windows, this would be <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-desktop#product-express-desktop-details'>Visual C++ 2012 Express for Windows Desktop</a>. The commercial version will also work. This is the latest version as of the 29 September 2012. Do yourself a favour and use this (or a later) version. We won&#8217;t be supporting older versions (tough in principle everything should work on the 2010 edition at least). If you don&#8217;t like the GUI, it is possible to build via the command line (see below).</p>

<p>On Linux, we compile with the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) and GNU Make. Other compilers (like LLVM/Clang) are currently not supported.</p>

<h3 id='a_unixbash_environment'>A Unix/Bash Environment</h3>

<p>This is needed to run the database import script.</p>

<p>If you use Linux, you already have this :)</p>

<p>On Windows if you use msys-git, you already have an MSYS install. You need to add <code>&lt;msys-git_intall_path&gt;\bin</code> (angle brackets indicate something you need to replace by a meaningful value for your own setup) to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. If you don&#8217;t know how to change an environment variable, just google it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can get it by downloading MinGW/MSYS <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/'>here</a>. Don&#8217;t forget to select <code>MSYS Base System</code> in the <code>Select Components</code> screen. You&#8217;ll need to add <code>&lt;mingw_install_path&gt;\msys\1.0\bin</code> to your path.</p>

<h3 id='a_note_about_the_command_line'>A Note About the Command Line</h3>

<p>You will use some of the software you&#8217;ll install on the command line. In order for the command line to find an executable, the path to it must be in an environment variable called <code>PATH</code> (aka &#8220;the path&#8221;).</p>

<p>You usually don&#8217;t have to take care of this on Linux, because the package managers place the executables in one of the standard <code>bin</code> directories. Those directories are added to the path by default. On Windows, the installers will generally take care of it. In the rare cases when you need to manually change environment variables, I will say so explicitly.</p>

<p>If you have a command line open and that the path changes, it isn&#8217;t automatically updated in the opened command line. You need to open a new up-to-date command line. On Windows you do this by invoking the run menu. Do so by pressing <code>WIN + R</code> or by going to <code>Start Menu &gt; Run...</code>. Once there type <code>cmd</code> and press enter.</p>

<p>On Linux you almost never need to take care of this, but if you do change the path manually, you&#8217;ll probably do so by editing a shell configuration file. Just source (if this is chinese to you, google it) the file in your shell to bring it up to date.</p>

<h2 id='compiling_the_core'>Compiling the Core</h2>

<p>We use the term &#8220;core&#8221; to distinguish the software that actually runs the server from other peripheral code and data such as the extractors and the database.</p>

<h3 id='cloning_the_repository'>Cloning the Repository</h3>

<p>First, you need to clone the git repository of the server. You can do this either on the command line or using the Github interface.</p>

<p>If you use the command line, go into the directory where you want to put the source files and run (note the dot at then end):</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ProjectSilverpine/server.git .</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work for some reason, you can also try:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/ProjectSilverpine/server.git .</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use Github, you need to have Github for Windows installed. Open it and go to <code>tools &gt; options...</code>. There, change the default storage directory to your convenience and write it down for further reference. Changing this field is the only way to control where the source files will end up, since the application does not prompt you for a location when cloning. Next, go to <a href='https://github.com/ProjectSilverpine/server'>the github page of the project</a> and click on &#8220;Clone on Windows&#8221;. This will create a <code>server</code> directory in the default storage directory. The repository will be cloned in it.</p>

<h3 id='running_cmake'>Running CMake</h3>

<p>Next you need to create an empty build directory. This directory can be anywhere, but I suggest you create it inside the directory where you cloned the git repo (henceforth: the source directory). It is conventional to give it a name starting by &#8220;build&#8221;. Create the directory now.</p>

<p>You now need to run CMake, either on the command line or with the GUI tool.</p>

<p>If you use the command line, go inside the build directory, then input the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cmake &lt;source directory&gt; PREFIX=&lt;desired install location&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you followed my guideline to place the build directory inside the source directory, <code>&lt;source directory&gt;</code> should simply be <code>..</code>.</p>

<p>The whole <code>PREFIX=</code> part can be ommited, in which case the install location will default to <code>C:\Program Files\Silverpine</code> (usually, I think it uses the <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> environement variable internally) on Windows, or <code>/etc/local/bin/Silverpine</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>Also note that this will use the default CMake generator. The generator dictates the type of build files CMake generates. In some cases, the default generator might not be what you want. In that case, use the <code>-G</code> command line switch followed by the generator names between double quotes. You can find a list of available generators <a href='http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.9/cmake.html#section_Generators'>here</a>.</p>

<p>There are other parameters that can be passed to this command to customize the build. See the <a href='#cmake_parameters_reference'>CMake Parameters Reference</a> section below for more information. In particular, for Linux you have to add <code>-DDEBUG</code> at the end of the command if you want to build the server in debug mode. This is not necessary if using Visual C++, because CMake uses a &#8220;multi-configuration generator&#8221; for that.</p>

<p>If you use the GUI, fill the <code>Where is the source code</code> field with the source directory and the <code>Where to build the binaries</code> field with the build directory. Press <code>Configure</code> and choose the appropriate generator. If you are following this guide on Windows, that would be <code>Visual Studio 11</code>. Keep <code>Use default
native compilers</code> checked.</p>

<p>You now have the opportunity to change the installation path (see the stuff about <code>PREFIX</code> above) and other parameters listed in the <a href='#cmake_parameters_reference'>CMake Parameters Reference</a> section. Once you are done, press <code>Generate</code>. You should now see a bunch of files in the build directory. In particular, you should see <code>Silverpine.sln</code> if you are using Visual Studio, and <code>Makefile</code> if you are using Linux.</p>

<h3 id='building_and_installing'>Building and Installing</h3>

<p>Once this is done, the only thing that is left is to run your build tool to actually compile the server. If you use Linux, it is simply:</p>

<pre><code>make
make install</code></pre>

<p>The first line compiles the server, while the second moves it to the install location. The server can actually be run from the build directory, see the <a href='#running_the_server_from_the_build_directory'>Running The Server From The Build Directory</a> section below.</p>

<p>If you are using Visual C++ and want to use the GUI, simply double click the <code>Silverpine.sln</code> file in the build directory and Visual C++ will run. First, select the type of build you want (<code>Release</code> or <code>Debug</code>) in a scrolling menu near the top of the screen. In the <code>Solution Explorer</code> panel, right click either the solution or the <code>ALL_BUILD</code> project and select <code>Build</code>. To install (see the part about <code>make install</code> above), right click the <code>INSTALL</code> project and select <code>Build</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to ue the command line, type</p>

<pre><code>cmake --build . --config &lt;Debug or Release&gt;
cmake --build . --target install --config &lt;Debug or Release&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Those commands are analogous to the <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> on Linux. Actually these commands should also work on Linux, tough the <code>--config</code> part isn&#8217;t relevant, because that gets chosen when you run CMake for the first time.</p>

<h2 id='extracting_the_vmaps_and_dbc_files'>Extracting the VMAPS and DBC files</h2>

<p>In order to run our server, we need to extract some files from the game client.</p>

<p>To extract the files, copy from the source directory <code>contrib/extractor/ad.exe</code> and the content of the <code>contrib/vmap_extract_assembler_bin</code> directory to your World of Warcraft 1.12 installation.</p>

<p>There run <code>ad.exe</code>. This will extract files into new <code>dbc</code> and <code>maps</code> directories. After that, run <code>makevmaps_SIMPLE.bat</code>. This will extract files into new <code>vmaps</code> and <code>Buildings</code> directories.</p>

<p><code>dbc</code> (standing for DataBaseClient) contains client-side database files containing data about items, NPC&#8217;s, enviroment, world, etc. These data also happen to be needed server-side. <code>maps</code> holds a 3D mesh of the world. <code>vmaps</code> (Vertical MAPS) holds collision data. It&#8217;s the stuff that prevents you from walking trough walls.</p>

<p>You can delete the <code>Buildings</code> directory (it&#8217;s a temporary folder created by the vmaps extractor and used as input by the vmaps assembler). Copy all other extracted directories to the <code>bin</code> directory under the install directory.</p>

<h2 id='setting_up_the_database'>Setting Up The Database</h2>

<h3 id='installing_the_database_server'>Installing the Database Server</h3>

<p>On Windows, after the MySQL server setup is complete, the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard will run. Here are the choices you must make.</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration Type: Detailed Configuration</li>

<li>Server Type: select what seems appropriate</li>

<li>Database Usage: Multifunctional Database</li>

<li>InnoDB Tablespace Settings: select the drive and path where you want the InnoDB data files to be stored. Basically, that&#8217;s where part of the data stored in your database will reside, so choose a fast disk that has some free space.</li>

<li>Approximate Number of Concurrent Connection: select what seems appropriate</li>

<li>Enable TCP/IP Networking: yes, note the port number, you&#8217;ll need it later.</li>

<li>Enable Strict Mode: yes</li>

<li>Default Character Set: Best Support for Multilingualism (UTF8)</li>

<li>[Windows] Install As Windows Service: yes</li>

<li>Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH: yes</li>

<li>Modify Security Settings: choose a root password</li>

<li>Create An Anonymous Account: no</li>
</ul>

<p>On Linux, some distro will prompt you for a root password. If this is not the case set the root password with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mysqladmin -u root -h localhost password &lt;password&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you want to change an existing password, add the <code>-p</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mysqladmin -u root -p -h localhost password &lt;password&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you want to be able to query the sql server as root from another machine, you need to rerun this command by substituting <code>localhost</code> by the IP/hostname used to reach the server from the other machine.</p>

<p>You should also run <code>mysql_secure_installation</code>. This will suggest security improvements that you may choose to apply or not depending on what you want to do with your server.</p>

<h3 id='populating_the_databases'>Populating the Databases</h3>

<p>First, you need to get a copy of the databases content, which is kept in a git repository. Clone the database repo like you did the server repo. The location doesn&#8217;t matter. If using the GUI, clone from <a href='https://github.com/ProjectSilverpine/database'>here</a>. If using the command line, type:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ProjectSilverpine/database.git .</code></pre>

<p>Now, edit the <code>mysql_info</code> file. In our setup, <code>USER</code> should be <code>root</code> and <code>PASS</code> the password you entered during the MySQL configuration step. You can leave <code>HOST</code> as localhost (meaning the database server runs on the machine from which we&#8217;ll import the database data).</p>

<p>To populate the database, run the following command from the database directory (no GUI alternative here):</p>

<pre><code>bash mysql_import</code></pre>

<h3 id='configuring_and_updating_the_database'>Configuring and Updating the Database</h3>

<p>The database repository holds a snapshot of the database that is updated once in a while. Small changes to the current snapshot are kept in the server repository.</p>

<p>We need to access the database. Do so by launching MySQL Workbench (or your SQL frontend of choice). Double-click <code>Local instance MySQL</code> under <code>Open Connection
to Start Querying</code>. On Linux this might not be present, so you need to create it by clicking <code>New Connection</code> item and filling in the dialog.</p>

<p>In the <code>Object Browser</code> tab, expand <code>zp_realm &gt; Tables</code>, right click on the <code>realmlist</code> item and click on <code>Select Rows</code>. This will bring up a panel called <code>realmlist 1</code>. In there, you can edit the name of your server. This is the name that will show up in the realm selection window, inside the game.</p>

<p>You can also set the IP address that the server will be accessed by. By default, it is your local IP address, the IP that identifies you on your Local Area Network (LAN). If you wish to restrict access to the server to your computer only, put the value <code>127.0.0.1</code> there. If you wish to make your server accessible from the internet, you need to put your <a href='http://www.ip-adress.com/'>public IP address</a>. On most home computers, this address changes once in a while (e.g. every day) so you might wish to setup a domain name to redirect to your current IP address. This can be done via providers such as <a href='http://www.no-ip.com/personal/'>no-ip</a>.</p>

<p>Next bring up the <code>zp_world &gt; db_version</code> table (same process as before). Look at the name of the third column. Note the number that is prefixed with the <code>z</code> character. Then, go to the <code>sql/updates</code> directory inside the server repository. In the MySQL workbench, open each file (folder icon) that has a bigger number than the one you noted. For each file, look at the word that follows the third underscore in its name. It should be something like <code>mangos</code> or <code>characters</code>. It indicates to which database you must apply the patch. <code>mangos</code> means the world database; the others are pretty obvious. Apply patches in increasing number order. Apply a patch by double-clicking on the database you wish to apply it to, then by clicking on the thunder icon.</p>

<p>When updates are made to the database, they&#8217;ll always come in the form of patches. So you won&#8217;t need to use the database repository again.</p>

<p>Note that we are currently displeased with the process for making updates to the database, so this might change soon.</p>

<h2 id='configuring_and_running_your_server'>Configuring and Running Your Server</h2>

<h3 id='configuring_the_server'>Configuring the Server</h3>

<p>We need to edit the configuration files that are in the <code>etc</code> directory under the install directory. Rename (or make a copy of) each file ending in <code>.dist</code> and change the name to remove the <code>.dist</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>mangosd.conf</code>, you need to edit the three <code>&lt;database&gt;DatabaseInfo</code> fields. Set the ip address and port of the database server. If you run them on the same machine, the default <code>127.0.0.1</code> is fine. The default port is also the MySQL server default. You need to replace the <code>mangos;mangos</code> part by your MySQL username (<code>root</code> assuming you have followed this guide) and password. Finally change the database names to <code>zp_realm</code>, <code>zp_world</code> and <code>zp_characters</code>. In case you were wondering, <code>zp</code> stands for &#8220;Zero Project&#8221; and is used for historical reasons.</p>

<p>If you changed the port in the <code>realmlist</code> table of the database, change it also under the <code>WorldServerPort</code> field.</p>

<p>We said earlier to copy the extracted <code>maps</code>, <code>vmaps</code> and <code>dbc</code> directories to the <code>bin</code> directory. This corresponds to the default value of the <code>DataDir</code> field. If you want to put the extracted files elsewhere, just update this field accordingly.</p>

<p>In <code>realmd.conf</code>, change the <code>LoginDatabaseInfo</code> field in the same way as the corresponding field in <code>mangosd.conf</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>scriptdevzero.conf</code>, change the <code>ScriptDevZeroDatabaseInfo</code> field in the same way as similar fields in the other files. The database name needs to be replaced by <code>zp_scripts</code>.</p>

<h3 id='running_the_server'>Running The Server</h3>

<p>To run the server, simply go in the <code>bin</code> directory under the install directory and launch the <code>realmd</code> and <code>mangosd</code> executables. On Windows, those have a <code>.exe</code> file extension. <code>realmd</code> is the login server while <code>mangosd</code> is the game server.</p>

<p>You can interact with <code>mangosd</code> trough a command prompt. On Windows the prompt will pop when you launch the program. On Linux, you&#8217;ll need to call the program from the command line to get the prompt or view any output.</p>

<p>To get to the prompt, you might have to press ENTER. Once you are there, you can create new accounts and set their privilege level. Create a user with <code>account
create &lt;user&gt; &lt;pass&gt;</code>. Make the user a Game Master (GM) with <code>account set
gmlevel &lt;user&gt; 3</code>. The GM level gives users access to various commands. Check the <a href='http://project-silverpine.com/devwiki/index.php?
title=Command_reference'>command reference</a> for more info (only the commands marked <code>112</code> are usable!).</p>

<h3 id='connecting_to_the_server'>Connecting to the Server</h3>

<p>Finally, go to your WoW 1.12 installation and edit the <code>realmlist.wtf</code> file to read <code>set realmlist &lt;server-ip&gt;</code>. You should use the same IP address as the one that is in the <code>realmlist</code> table of the <code>zp_realm</code> database (this assumes the login server runs on the same machine as the game server). You can use C-style line comments (<code>//</code>) if you need to switch between multiple servers:</p>

<pre><code>set realmlist 127.0.0.1 // my home server
// set realmlist login.otherserver.com // other server</code></pre>

<p>If you did everything right and I didn&#8217;t screw my guide, you can now connect to your server. Congratulations!</p>

<h2 id='cmake_parameters_reference'>CMake Parameters Reference</h2>

<p>When invoking CMake (in order to generate build files), you can specify the values of some variables. On the command line, you do this by appending <code>-D&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> (note the absence of spaces) at the end of your command. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>cmake .. -DDEBUG=TRUE -DPREFIX=&quot;C:\Program Files\MyServer\&quot;</code></pre>

<p>On the GUI, the customizable variables will simply show up in the middle of the window, where you can customize them at will.</p>

<p>Most variables are boolean: either true or false. Unless stated otherwise, boolean variables default to false.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>DEBUG</code></dt>

<dd>Compile with debug information and checks. Not need for multi-configuration CMake generators such as Visual Studio.</dd>

<dt><code>PREFIX</code></dt>

<dd>The path where the server should be installed. Absolute or relative to the source directory.</dd>

<dt><code>USE_STD_MALLOC</code></dt>

<dd>Use the standard library malloc function instead of the one from Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB). I guess this can be useful for debugging or if on your machine the standard malloc outperforms the TBB one.</dd>

<dt><code>NOPCH</code></dt>

<dd>Don&#8217;t use precompiled headers. This will increase build time. I&#8217;m not quite sure in which situation this is useful. Currently broken with Visual Studio.</dd>

<dt><code>ACE_USE_EXTERNAL</code></dt>

<dd>Use an external ACE library instead of the one bundled with the server. Useful if you run multiple servers on your machine or if some other software is already using the ACE libraries. This way, you avoid loading the libraries in memory multiple times.</dd>

<dt><code>TBB_USE_EXTERNAL</code></dt>

<dd>Same story as ACE_USE_EXTERNAL but for the TBB libraries.</dd>

<dt><code>ACE_ROOT</code></dt>

<dd>The path were the external ACE library resides. Only meaningful if <code>ACE_USE_EXTERNAL</code> is TRUE. Some default locations will be tried if not supplied.</dd>

<dt><code>TBB_ROOT</code></dt>

<dd>The path were the external TBB library resides. Only meaningful if <code>TBB_USE_EXTERNAL</code> is TRUE. Some default locations will be tried if not supplied.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id='running_the_server_from_the_build_directory'>Running The Server From The Build Directory</h2>

<p>Sometimes it makes sense to run the server from the build directory. In particular if you want to attach a debugger to the server, some IDEs such as Visual Studio are quite picky about the location of the executables. It expects to find them at the place where they were created, so in the build directory instead of the install directory.</p>

<p>To this effect, the server can be run from the build directory. With a regular generator (not a multi-configuration one), you&#8217;ll find the usual <code>bin</code> and <code>etc</code> directories under the build directory. With a multi-configuration generator, things are slightly more complicated. The executables and libraries are placed in the <code>bin/&lt;configuration&gt;</code> directory. This means that the config files will be in <code>bin/etc</code>.</p>

<p>You still need to copy the extracted files, or to modify the <code>DataDir</code> field in <code>mangosd.conf</code>. Changing the config is probably the better idea, as I like to be able to delete my build directories without aftertoughts.</p>

<p>For the same reason (impunity in nuking the build directory), the config in the build directory is automatically copied from the <code>config</code> directory. To set up a custom config, start by building the project. Default configuration files will be generated in <code>&lt;build_directory&gt;/config</code>. Copy them over to the <code>config</code> directory, edit them to your liking then drop the <code>.dist</code> extension. The next time you compile, these configuration files will be copied to the proper location in the build directory in order to be used by the server if run from the build directory.</p>
